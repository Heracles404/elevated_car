	• Arduino - Emergency Button, if ever that the elevator stops in an uncertain area the button will automatically
			make the elevator go to first floor. 
	• DiagramHardware coding

	• Servo movement
	• Database
		• Table 1 - id, origin, destination
			◘ if table 1 is not empty go to `floor x` where `floor x` is equal to origin (oldest record)
			◘ if detected in `floor x`:
				task 1: update `origin` to zero where `origin` is equal to `floor x`
				task 2: delete data where `origin is zero` and `destination is equal to floor x`


Mobile App 
	• form - user input (origin [from what floor] and destination floor [to what floor] ) -> insert to database {origin and destination}
		◘ For every users, every device should have different unique ID (App Signature yung tawag dito sa function na gagawin ko)
		
		◘ Can accept values: id, origin, destination. After input, displays toast (Floor level). 
		
		◘ Initial Level Layouts/Functions: 
			Level 1 - Button for 2nd and 3rd level
			After clicking what level (2nd or 3rd - Lilipat sa table nung napili kasi mag iiba yung buttons)
		◘ Display Elevator status: 
			Waiting - origin not zero (wala pa laman elevator)
			Onboard - origin 0 {may nasa elevator)
			Arrive - origin = non existent (nasa floor na)
		◘ Level Button Functions: Insert (BTN Name: Submit)
			Level 1 - Button for 2nd and 3rd level
			Level 2 - Button for 1st and 3rd level
			Level 3 - Button for 1st and 2nd level
		

		◘ Table for monitoring (Real-time based on ID), Displays the database in mobile. 
		
		◘ Multiple layouts (para every button nakaka galaw)

Hardware
	• Multilevel platform
	• Servo
	• laser or other sensors to detect presence of elevator
